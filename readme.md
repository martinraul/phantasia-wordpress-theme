# Phantasia Wordpress Theme
` Phantasia (φαντασία): impression, appearance, perception. Epictetus says (1.1. 7–9) that the gods gave us one power that governs all the rest—“the ability to make the right use of appearances.” He also says that the first and greatest task of the philosopher is to test (δοκιμάζω, “to assay”) and separate appearances (see also 2.18.24).  

He uses the metaphors of sweeping currents, battle, and the rigorous training of an athlete for the work we must do to hold our own against impressions (2.18. 27–28). “The task of the good and excellent person is to handle their impressions in harmony with nature” (3.3.1).  

There are more than two hundred references to phantasia in the Discourses and nine in the Enchiridion (34). The term appears about forty times in Marcus’s Meditations (5.2, 5.16, 6.13, 8.7, 8.26, 8. 28–29). Marcus has a great exercise for not telling yourself more than initial impressions (“report” in 8.49).  `
